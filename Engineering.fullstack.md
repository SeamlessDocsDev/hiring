### User Story
As a user, I would like to fill out a form and have a field's value verified against a known dataset in real-time upon submission.

### Requirements
- Use client-side format validation, ie. email, phone number, social security number, etc
- Dataset value verification done via ajax request. Dataset stored as JSON on server-side.
- Verification options are: POST value must be within dataset, POST value unique to dataset, as a bonus POST value matches value in dataset and return supplemental value to form, ie. “lookup”. 
- Form submission blocked if field validation or verification failed. 
- Display client side message for both failure and success. 
- Code must be testable and **must** include tests.
- If using any frameworks, intallation instructions should be included in a readme.

### Extra Credit
All optional. Include as many as you want. 
- Page to meet WCAG standards and pass Siteimprove (include screenshot from Chrome extension)
